# Introduction

Greetings players! My name is sarah gwen schwengel & I'm here to invite you to play some D&D with a fun twist or two! My pronouns are diverse, and you'd best believe it'll slip into detached third person, especially when DM/GM-ing (it/she/they :3).

It would like to begin by welcoming you to its wonderful game of Dungeons, Dragons, Dolls, Diapers, Dabs, & more! I promise there would be more D's but we have to end somehwere :3 This game should be unlike anything you've ever encountered, owing to the power of the DM and the diverse group it wishes to accumulate to aid you in your quest!

Contained herein are informational resources to navigate the world of Gwenterra and its various systems. We'll start with an overview of the campaign as it yet exists, followed by a description of its aims and goals for play.

# Overview

You & your companions will play in the world of Gwenterra, which is definitely not just basically Earth with my name attached to it. To your knowledge, the world consists mostly of local dwellings: townships, towns, and maybe even a city or two. Most people you meet have lived in The Coomfederacy all their life, though travellers from strange lands are spoken of in legend.

Your party begins the adventure in the industrious local township of Shroobsburg, which is filled with all sorts of secrets and bullshit gimmicks to excite the mind. Nearby whaling vessels, sleeping mudmen, & powerful hermits will invite the players to seek adventure in the great beyond! And the drinks will keep them coming back for more!

Players will begin with a simple world quest: The Byeahcrawl, which establishes Gwenterra as a realm of the wider Jermaverse. Further adversaries such as Robbie Rotten & the Bad Apples will become more relevant to the characters as they discover the treacherous plots enacted by puppet masters from the shadows. Will you sow the seeds of doll rebellion? Enact cruel servitude among a new race of tulpa slaves you create? Who knows!!??

It aims to run the same general skeleton of the campaign over many iterations, such that it can explore the many facets of its rich world. The delight of something gone wrong, a path unexplored, or a new one concoted on the spot will give this one ideas for future play and even possibly some interaction down the line. It makes no promises, yet it dreams big!
