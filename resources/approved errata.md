Some notes of when I disagreed with the class as stated.

- good creation lore
- good society lore
- names in this universe follow shadows house convention, where the doll takes an alternate/nick-name of its master
- alignment should favor individual vision
    - heavily in alignment with creator?
    - OR heavily against alignment with creator?

- dolls should have a sort of patron relationship with their creator, especially if they are a pact class like paladin or warlock
    - group patron options, a dollmaster of sorts

### class options
- warlock
    - creator patron / selfcest patron / doll nonsense
    - bond of the talisman flavor
    - dolls as familiars? options for players to play as familiars?

### grand design
- reinforced frame nerf?
